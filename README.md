# vGLFW

## Description
GLFW wrapper for the V language.

## Documentation
Please follow the official [GLFW documentation](https://www.glfw.org/documentation.html)

## Install
`v install https://github.com/duarteroso/vglfw`

## Changes
**Notice**: The `GLFW_init()` function is called `initialize()` in V since `init` is reserved.
Also some of the functions are struct-oriented so you do `window.<function>` which is different from C.

## Example
A simple usage of the package can be found in the [example](./examples/) folder.
